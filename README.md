A Flutter project for entering and tracking blood glucose levels.

This project integrates with Amazon Web Services:
    - Cognito - provides user management (sign up, login, password reset)
    - Lambda - logs BG values to dynamodb, sends SNS messages to receivers
    - Dynamodb - provides storage and retrieval of BG values
